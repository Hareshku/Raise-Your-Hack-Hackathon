**ArcCommerce: AI-Powered Travel Booking
ArcCorp Hackathon 2025**

**ArcCommerce** is an AI-driven travel booking solution built for the Prosus Track. It uses a proprietary SynapTran architecture to convert user intent to APIs and decouples natural language from raw LLM behavior. The system introduces an intent-routing core for safe and controlled LLM usage, ensuring traceability, backend logic control, and security. It is positioned as a next-gen e-commerce engine for structured and intelligent travel booking.



# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
